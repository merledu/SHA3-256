SHA3-256 is a cryptographic module for making hash. The algorithm works
using a method called the Keccak sponge construction. This method involves two main
phases: absorb and squeeze. It takes input data of any size and generates a fixed 256-
bit output called a digest. It is a one-way processâ€”once data is hashed, we cannot get back
the original data. This makes the algorithm useful for verifying data integrity, creating digital
signatures, and ensuring secure storage.
