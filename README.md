# SHA3-256
SHA3-256 is a cryptographic module for making hash, The algorithm works
using a method called the Keccak sponge construction. This method involves two main
phases: absorb and squeeze. it takes input data of any size and generates a fixed 256-
bit output called digest. it is a one way process once data is hashed, we cannot get back
original data. This makes algorithm useful for verifying data integrity, creating digital
signatures, and ensuring secure storage.
